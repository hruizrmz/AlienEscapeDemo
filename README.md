Alien Escape

Roblox Experience: https://www.roblox.com/games/95608909103723/Alien-Escape-Demo

A space station has been overtaken by aliens! Run to an escape pod before they take off. If you get caught, you'll be eaten and transformed... ðŸ‘½

This hide and seek style demo features:
- Two roles: humans and aliens
- A maze-like level that amps up the thrills
- Force field walls that only humans can cross
- Points to rank players from that session

This was my first time making a game with Roblox Studio, including scripting with Lua and Rojo!
